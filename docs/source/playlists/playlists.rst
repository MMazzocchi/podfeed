Playlists
=========

``Playlist`` objects represent an ordered list of episodes. Once created, a
``Playlist`` can be saved as an `M3U <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U>`_ file,
which is playable by most audio media players.

The M3U generated will be a list of links to the individual episodes. Therefore,
playing the M3U will require the audo player to have Internet access.
